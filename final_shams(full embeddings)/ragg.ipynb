The text explicitly states he became “even more anxious and withdrawn” *after* Shams returned. The return itself, rather than offering resolution, was triggering his underlying fear of separation.\n",
      "*   **No “Spell” or Assassins:** Aladdin’s accusation that Shams put a “spell” on Rumi’s father and that he was sent by the “Assassins” is a misunderstanding fueled by grief and fear. If Shams hadn’t died, this narrative would never have developed, and Rumi wouldn't have been burdened by this belief.\n",
      "*   **A Different Relationship Dynamic:** The entire tension between Rumi and his father, as Aladdin perceives it, would not exist. Rumi's father’s “helplessness” in the face of his wife’s death is a crucial element in Aladdin's interpretation of events, and that would have been absent.\n",
