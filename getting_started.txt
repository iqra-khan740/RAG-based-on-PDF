Tutorial: Get started with Visual Studio Code
In this tutorial, you learn about the key features of Visual Studio Code to help you get started with coding quickly. You learn about the different components of the user interface and how to customize it to your liking. You then write some code and use the built-in code editing features, such as IntelliSense and Code Actions, and you learn about running and debugging your code. By installing a language extension, you add support for a different programming language.
Tip
If you prefer to follow along with a video, you can watch the
Getting Started video
, which covers the same steps as this tutorial.
Prerequisites
Download and install Visual Studio Code on your computer
Open a folder in VS Code
You can use VS Code to work on individual files to make quick edits, or you can open a folder, also known as a
workspace
.
Let's start by creating a folder and opening it in VS Code. You'll use this folder throughout the tutorial.
Open Visual Studio Code and select
File
>
Open Folder...
from the menu to open a folder.
Select
New Folder
and create a new folder named
vscode101
. Then select
Select Folder
(
Open
on macOS) to open the folder in VS Code.
VS Code now considers the folder you've opened a workspace.
On the Workspace Trust dialog, select
Yes, I trust the authors
to enable all features in the workspace.
Important
Workspace Trust lets you decide whether code in your project folder can be executed by VS Code. When you download code from the internet, you should first review it to make sure it's safe to run. Get more info about
Workspace Trust
.
You should now see the
Explorer
view on the left, showing the name of the folder.
You'll use the Explorer view to view and manage the files and folders in your workspace.
Tip
When you open a folder in VS Code, VS Code can restore the UI state for that folder, such as the open files, the active view, and the layout of the editor. You can also configure settings that only apply to that folder, or define debug configurations. Get more info about
workspaces
.
Explore the user interface
Now that you have a folder open in VS Code, let's take a quick tour of the user interface.
Switch between views with the Activity Bar
Use the Activity Bar to switch between different views.
Tip
Hover over the Activity Bar to see the name of each view and the corresponding keyboard shortcut. You can toggle a view open and closed by selecting the view again or pressing the keyboard shortcut.
When you select a view in the Activity Bar, the
Primary Side Bar
opens to show view-specific information.
For example, the Run and Debug view enables you to configure and start debugging sessions.
View and edit files with the Editor
Select the Explorer view in the Activity Bar, and select the
New File...
button to create a new file in your workspace.
Enter the name
index.html
and press
Enter
.
A file is added to your workspace and an Editor opens in the main area of the window.
Start typing some HTML code in the
index.html
file.
As you type, you should see suggestions popping up that help you complete your code (
IntelliSense
). You can use the
Up
and
Down
keys to navigate the suggestions, and
Tab
to insert the selected suggestion.
Add more files to your workspace and notice that each file opens a new Editor tab.
You can open as many editors as you like and view them side by side vertically or horizontally. Learn more about
side by side editing
.
Access the terminal from the Panel area
VS Code has an integrated terminal. Open it by pressing
⌃`
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+`
)
. You can also use the
View
>
Terminal
menu item.
You can choose between different shells, such as PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Bash, depending on your operating system configuration.
In the terminal, enter the following command to create a new file in your workspace.
echo
"Hello, VS Code"
>
greetings.txt
The default working folder is the root of your workspace. Notice that the Explorer view automatically picks up and shows the new file.
You can open multiple terminals simultaneously. Select the
Launch Profile
dropdown to view the available shells and choose one.
Access commands with the Command Palette
Open the
Command Palette
by pressing
⇧⌘P
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+Shift+P
)
. You can also use the
View
>
Command Palette
menu item.
Many of the commands in VS Code are available through the Command Palette. When you install extensions, they can add extra commands to the Command Palette.
Tip
Notice that the Command Palette shows the default keyboard shortcut for commands that have one. You can use the keyboard shortcut to run the command directly.
The Command Palette supports different modes of operation:
Command mode (
>
)
: after the
>
symbol, start typing to filter the command list. For example, type
move terminal
to find commands to move the terminal to a new window.
Quick Open mode
: remove the
>
character and start typing to search for files in your workspace. You can use the
⌘P
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+P
)
keyboard shortcut to open the Command Palette and start searching for files directly.
Symbol search mode (
#
)
: replace the
>
character by
#
to search for symbols like variables or functions in your code.
Tip
VS Code uses fuzzy matching to find files or commands. For example, typing
odks
returns the
Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts
command.
Configure VS Code settings
You can customize almost every part of VS Code by configuring settings. You can use the
Settings Editor
to modify the settings in VS Code or directly modify the
settings.json
file.
Press
⌘,
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+,
)
to open the Settings Editor (or select the
File
>
Preferences
>
Settings
menu item).
Tip
Use the search box to filter the list of settings that are shown.
By default, VS Code doesn't automatically save modified files. Select a value from the Auto Save dropdown to change this behavior.
VS Code automatically applies changes to settings. When you modify a file in your workspace, it should now be automatically saved.
To revert a setting to its default value, select the gear icon next to the setting and select
Reset Setting
.
Tip
You can quickly find all modified settings by typing
@modified
in the search box or selecting the
Modified
filter.
You can use the tabs in the Settings Editor to switch between
User
settings and
Workspace
settings.
User settings apply across all your workspaces. Workspace settings only apply to the current workspace. Workspace settings override user settings. Get more information about
settings in VS Code
.
Write some code
VS Code has built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and more. In this tutorial, you create a sample JavaScript file and use some of the code editing features that VS Code offers.
VS Code supports many programming languages and in a next step, you'll
install a language extension
to add support for a different language, namely Python.
In the Explorer view, create a new file
app.js
, and start typing the following JavaScript code:
function
sayHello
(
name
) {
console
.
log
(
'Hello, '
+
name
);
}
sayHello
(
'VS Code'
);
As you type, you should see suggestions popping up that help you complete your code (
IntelliSense
). You can use the
Up
and
Down
keys to navigate the suggestions, and
Tab
to insert the selected suggestion.
Notice also the formatting of the code (
syntax highlighting
), to help you distinguish between different parts of the code.
When you put the cursor on the string
Hello,
, you should see a lightbulb icon appear to indicate there's a Code Action.
You can also use the
⌃Space
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+Space
)
keyboard shortcut to open the lightbulb menu.
Select the lightbulb icon, and then select
Convert to template string
.
Code Actions are suggestions to apply quick fixes to your code. In this case, the Code Action converts
""Hello, " + name
into a
template string
`Hello, ${name}`
, which is a special JavaScript construct to embed expressions in strings.
Learn more about code
editing features
,
IntelliSense
,
code navigation
, and
refactoring
in VS Code.
Use source control
Visual Studio Code has integrated source control management (SCM) and includes
Git
support out-of-the-box.
Let's use the built-in Git support to commit the changes you've made previously.
Select the
Source Control
view in the Activity Bar to open the Source Control view.
Make sure you have
Git
installed on your computer. If you don't have Git installed, you'll see a button in the Source Control view to install it on your machine.
Select
Initialize Repository
to create a new Git repository for your workspace.
After you initialize a repository, the Source Control view shows the changes you've made in your workspace.
You can stage individual changes by hovering over a file and selecting
+
next to a file.
Tip
To stage all changes, hover over
Changes
and select the
Stage All Changes
button.
Enter a commit message, for example
Add hello function
, and then select the
Commit
to commit the changes to your Git repository.
Tip
Select
Graph
in the Source Control view to show a visual representation of the commit history of your Git repository.
There's a lot more to discover about source control in VS Code. Get more info about
source control in VS Code
.
Install a language extension
VS Code has a rich ecosystem of extensions that let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your specific development workflow. There are thousands of extensions available in the
Visual Studio Marketplace
.
Let's install a language extension to add support for Python, or any other programming language you are interested in.
Select the
Extensions
view in the Activity Bar.
The Extensions view enables you to browse and install extensions from within VS Code.
Enter
Python
in the Extension view search box to browse for Python-related extensions. Select the
Python
extension published by Microsoft, and then select the
Install
button.
Now, create a new Python file
hello.py
in your workspace, and start typing the following Python code:
def
say_hello
(
name
):
print
(
"Hello, "
+ name)
say_hello(
"VS Code"
)
Notice that you now also get suggestions and IntelliSense for the Python code.
Run and debug your code
VS Code has built-in support for running and debugging Node.js applications. In this tutorial, you use the Python extension you installed in the previous step to debug a Python program.
Let's debug the
hello.py
program that you created in the previous step.
Make sure that
Python 3
is installed on your computer.
If there's no Python interpreter installed on your computer, you'll see a notification in the lower right corner of the window. Select
Select Interpreter
to open the
Command Palette
and select the Python interpreter you want to use or install one.
In the
hello.py
file, place the cursor on the
print
line and press
F9
to set a breakpoint.
A red dot appears in the left margin of the editor, indicating that a breakpoint is set. With a breakpoint, you can pause the execution of your program at a specific line of code.
Press
F5
to start a debugging session.
Select the Python debugger:
Choose to run the current Python file:
Notice that the program starts and that the execution stops at the breakpoint you set.
Tip
Inspect the value of the
name
variable by hovering over it in the editor while the execution is paused. You can view the value of variables at any time in the
Variables
view in the
Run and Debug
view.
Press the
Continue
button in the Debug toolbar or press
F5
to continue the execution.
There are many more debugging features in VS Code, such as watch variables, conditional breakpoints, and launch configurations. Dive into the details of
debugging in VS Code
.
Enhance your coding with AI and GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you write code faster, and can help you with a wide range of tasks, such as code completion, code refactoring, and fixing errors.
Let's get started by getting code suggestions from Copilot.
Make sure you have set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Follow the steps in our
Copilot Setup
guide.
Tip
If you don't have a Copilot subscription yet, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the
Copilot Free plan
and get a monthly limit of inline suggestions and chat interactions.
In the
hello.py
file, place the cursor at the end of the file and type this function header.
def
say_day_of_week
(
date
)
Copilot will automatically suggest the rest of the function. Accept the code suggestion by pressing
Tab
.
Next, let's invoke our new function.
say_day_of_week(date.today())
Notice that there's a squiggle on the
date
keyword, indicating that there's an error.
Put the cursor, on the
date
keyword, select the
lightbulb
icon, and then select
Fix
.
Copilot will suggest a fix for the error. Select
Accept
if you're happy with the suggestion.
